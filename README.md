# ConsoleAPP
Stores all my console nonsense in C Language

I used VS 2022 to make these.
Use the .sln in ConsoleTest to profit.


GoodStuff.c greets user and offers to change console title before it creates a box of user defined size with a little loading animation in the center.

MovingCursor.c turns the console into a useless text whiteboard, user can use the arrow key to move the cursor. It's surprisingly hard to code.

Mouse.c is a hardcore-af mouse positioning challenge which requires user to click the randomly placed cursor.
